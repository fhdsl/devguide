## Discuss first

In most cases it's a good idea to start a discussion before opening a pull request.

You can do this by opening an issue in the relavant GitHub repository, starting a discusison in the [FH-Data Slack](https://fhdata.slack.com/) or emailing the maintainer. The best option is opening an issue as that keeps the discussion of the code paired with the code.

If you open an issue, there should be an issue template that will give instructions.

Make sure to include a [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex)!

# Documentation {{< iconify fa6-solid book >}} {#sec-docs}

All formally supported DaSL R and Python packages should have package documentation.

## R

We use the package [pkgdown][] to create documentation for R packages.

For R packages, docs should be hosted on GitHub pages.

### DaSL pkgdown template

We are planning to have a DaSL specific `pkgdown` "package template" (see [pkgdown docs][pkgdowntemp] for what this means) - but it's not ready to use yet. When it is ready, you will be able to specify our template like:

```yml
template:
  package: dasltemplate
```

For now just use the default theme that `pkgdown` provides.

## Python

We use the package [Sphinx][] to create documentation for Python packages.

For Python packages, docs should be hosted on [ReadTheDocs][rtd].

`Sphinx` is less automatic relative to `pkgdown`, so just be prepared for more manual work with `Sphinx`.

## Guidelines

- README: This is most likely the first place potential users will interact with your package. Make sure the README clearly states what the package does, and how to get started.
- Examples: All user facing functions should have examples. Make sure to be careful about how examples are run if there's any sensitive data or connections to remote services.
- (anything else?)

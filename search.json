If you want to have any problems fixed automatically and committed to your main branch, run:\nusethis::use_github_action(\"style\")\nNote that the above action will create commits all with the same message: \"Style code (GHA)\".\nWe think in most cases it makes sense to only use the lint action and not the style action, but you’re free to use either or both.",

In these cases, code review of PRs should be swift.\n\n\n3.2.2 Solo developer\nThere will be many cases within the WILDS where there is only one person working on the project - and there isn’t anyone available within DASL to review code. In these cases, tests and automation are particularly important.\nThese projects should strive to get other DASL staff to review code, but turnaround times on reviews are not likely to be fast.\n\n\n3.2.3 Understudy\nThis could be a more junior DASL staff member, or an external contributor that’s still “learning the ropes”. In these cases PR reviews should be swift to make sure the understudy is getting feedback quickly so they know the lead maintainer is interested in their work.\n\n\n3.2.4 External\nExternal contributions may be one-off drive by contributions from someone that may not contribute again, or contributions from a regular external contributor. Although DASL staff need not fully address these immediately, we should make every effort to reply quickly so the external contributor knows a human at DASL is aware of their contribution and will address it soon.",

See pkgdown documentation for details on configuring documentation.\nAfter pushing the above changes up to your repository, go to the Actions tab and you should see the new publish action running. It will build and then deploy the rendered package docs. The URL for your docs will vary depending on the GitHub organization your repository lives within. For WILDS, the base URL is https://getwilds.org. If your package is in the WILDS org (at https://github.com/getwilds) your package (named mypkg) docs would live at https://getwilds.org/mypkg.\nYou can also build pkgdown docs locally - after running usethis::use_pkgdown() or usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() - by running pkgdown::build_site(). If you run build_site() within RStudio it should open up your site in your default browser, but may not do so if you run in a terminal.

Function documentation is great if you know the name of the function you need, but it’s useless otherwise. In contrast, a vignette can be framed around a target problem that your package is designed to solve. The vignette format is perfect for showing a workflow that solves that particular problem, start to finish. Vignettes afford you different opportunities than help topics: you have much more control over the integration of code and prose and it’s a better setting for showing how multiple functions work together.”",

Please follow that chapter in general for versioning of R and Python packages within the WILDS. To make it easier to grok, below are some of the highlights, and some exceptions to that chapter.\n\n8.2.1 Package version numbers\nThere’s quite a bit of nuance - and surprises - to package version numbers - see the Package version number section for details. For example, using the utils::package_version() function, which parses package version strings into S3 classes, we get a suprising result:\n\n\"2.0\" &gt; \"10.0\"\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\npackage_version(\"2.0\") &gt; package_version(\"10.0\")\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\n\nWith that example, please do think about your package versions before setting them.\n\n8.2.1.1 WILDS Conventions\nFollowing the Tidyverse package version conventions, WILDS packages will use the following conventions (see the link for more details):\n\nAlways use . as the separator, never use -.\nA released version number consists of three components, &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;\nWhile a package is in between releases, there is a fourth component: the development version, starting at 9000 (e.g., 0.2.2.9000), and incrementing from there until the package has another release at which point return to three components.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Ignore these\nWe are not following or enforcing any rules about changes at the function/class/etc level below the package level. For example, the R Packages book talks about using the lifecycle package to deal with function changes.",

An ideal use-case would proceed as follows:\n\nA researcher reviews the repository to deem whether it is relevant for their needs, starting with the README for the over-arching purpose of the workflow, but extending to the the input json and WDL script itself for specific questions about toolsets, settings, and input/output data types.\nIf the workflow seems useful, the researcher clones the repository locally, makes minimal updates to the input json, and executes the code with minimal effort using their favorite WDL executor.\nIf the researcher would like to add their own flavor to the workflow, they can fork the repository, customize it as necessary to fit their exact research needs, and even resubmit the changes back to the original repository for consideration and review.\n\nTo that end, WILDS WDL repositories are relatively minimal and will usually consist of:\n\na detailed README describing the intended functionality and input/output file types\na single WDL script containing the workflow as well as the tasks that make up the workflow\na input json template providing examples of expected inputs\na test case to ensure the workflow is running as expected\n\nWe believe the minimal nature of this setup will aid from a readability/ease-of-use standpoint.",

Badges are a widely used standard in source code repositories, and help quickly indicate to a potential user something typically important about the repository.\nWILDS badges are maintained in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/getwilds/badges. There’s a website for these badges and an easy click to copy interface at https://getwilds.org/badges/.\nAn example badge: \n\n\n11.2.3 Contributing instructions\nAll WILDS repos should have a CONTRIBUTING.md file. Although this file could live in many different places in a repository, in WILDS repositories it should live in the .github/ directory.\nSee also GitHub’s docs on CONTRIBUTING.md.\nThere is a default CONTRIBUTING.md file for all WILDS repos at https://github.com/getwilds/.github. We encourage repo maintainers to add their own CONTRIBUTING.md file if the default is not adequate.\n\n\n11.2.4 Pull request templates\nAll WILDS repos should have one or more pull request templates.

For R packages, we recommend using the following three:\n\nuse_github_action(\"check-standard\")\nuse_github_action(\"lint\")\nuse_github_action(\"pkgdown\")\n\nPython: There is no tool available for Python similar to usethis - one has to manually add workflow files. For Python packages we recommend following GitHub’s guide on Building and Testing Python. As there are many different ways to make and maintain Python packages, you will need to decide what steps are needed for your package.",

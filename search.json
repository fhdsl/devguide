    "text": "5.1 R\nWe use the pkgdown package to create documentation for R packages, and host it on GitHub Pages. To get started with pkgdown, in R within the root of your package run usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() - it will set up a _pkgdown.yml file in the root of your repo used to configure pkgdown, and add a .github/workflows/publish.yml file to build the package documentation on each push, pull request, or release. See pkgdown documentation for details on configuring documentation.\nAfter pushing the above changes up to your repository, go to the Actions tab and you should see the new publish action running. It will build and then deploy the rendered package docs. The URL for your docs will vary depending on the GitHub organization your repository lives within. For WILDS, the base URL for now is https://getwilds.github.io. If your pacakge was in the WILDS org (at https://github.com/getwilds) your package (named mypkg) docs would live at https://getwilds.github.io/mypkg.\nYou can also build pkgdown docs locally - after running usethis::use_pkgdown() or usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() - by running pkgdown::build_site(). If you run build_site() within RStudio it should open up your site in your default browser, but may not do so if you run in a terminal. You can open the site in your browser by navigating to and opening the file docs/index.html within your repo.\n\n5.1.1 DaSL pkgdown template\nWe are planning to have a DaSL specific pkgdown “package template” (see pkgdown docs for what this means) - but it’s not ready to use yet. When it is ready, you will be able to specify our template like:\ntemplate:\n  package: dasltemplate\nFor now just use the default theme that pkgdown provides."

Please follow that chapter in general for versioning of R and Python packages within DaSL. To make it easier to grok, below are some of the highlights, and some exceptions to that chapter.\n\n6.1.1 Package version numbers\nThere’s quite a bit of nuance - and surprises - to package version numbers - see the Package version number section for details. For example, using the utils::package_version() function, which parses package version strings into S3 classes, we get a suprising result:\n\n\"2.0\" &gt; \"10.0\"\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\npackage_version(\"2.0\") &gt; package_version(\"10.0\")\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\n\nWith that example, please do think about your package versions before setting them.\n\n6.1.1.1 DaSL Conventions\nFollowing the Tidyverse package version conventions, DaSL packages will use the following conventions (see the link for more details):\n\nAlways use . as the separator, never use -.\nA released version number consists of three components, &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;\nWhile a package is in between releases, there is a fourth component: the development version, starting at 9000 (e.g., 0.2.2.9000), and incrementing from there until the package has another release at which point return to three components.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Ignore these\nWe are not following or enforcing any rules about changes at the function/class/etc level below the package level. For example, the R Packages book talks about using the lifecycle package to deal with function changes."

However, when PII/PHI data is a crucial part of an example for a function/class/etc. we need to take extra precautions.\nIn package documentation created with pkgdown (see Chapter 5) examples should use fake data included with the package.\nIf it makes sense to have examples that run with real data that might be PII/PHI data, those examples should xxxx"

It includes both internal facing guidelines as well as for any contributions from folks other than DaSL staff.\nIn the WILDS we primarily develop software in the R and Python programming languages.

In the file created (.lintr) you can set custom congifuration as needed for your package (see the lintr vignette).\nNext, run:\nusethis::use_github_action(\"lint\")\nwhich creates a file .github/workflows/lint.yaml in your package to run lintr checks on your package. This action only reports problems and does not fix them for you. If you want to have any problems fixed automatically and committed to your main branch, run:\nusethis::use_github_action(\"style\")\nNote that the above action will create commits all with the same message: \"Style code (GHA)\".\nWe think in most cases it makes sense to only use the lint action and not the style action, but you’re free to use either or both.",

See pkgdown documentation for details on configuring documentation.\nAfter pushing the above changes up to your repository, go to the Actions tab and you should see the new publish action running. It will build and then deploy the rendered package docs. The URL for your docs will vary depending on the GitHub organization your repository lives within. For WILDS, the base URL is https://getwilds.org. If your package is in the WILDS org (at https://github.com/getwilds) your package (named mypkg) docs would live at https://getwilds.org/mypkg.\nYou can also build pkgdown docs locally - after running usethis::use_pkgdown() or usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() - by running pkgdown::build_site(). If you run build_site() within RStudio it should open up your site in your default browser, but may not do so if you run in a terminal.

Make sure the README clearly states what the package does, and how to get started.\nExamples: All user facing functions should have examples. Make sure to be careful about how examples are run if there’s any sensitive data or connections to remote services.\nVignettes: From the R Packages book: “A vignette is a long-form guide to your package. Function documentation is great if you know the name of the function you need, but it’s useless otherwise. In contrast, a vignette can be framed around a target problem that your package is designed to solve. The vignette format is perfect for showing a workflow that solves that particular problem, start to finish. Vignettes afford you different opportunities than help topics: you have much more control over the integration of code and prose and it’s a better setting for showing how multiple functions work together.”",

Please follow that chapter in general for versioning of R and Python packages within the WILDS. To make it easier to grok, below are some of the highlights, and some exceptions to that chapter.\n\n5.2.1 Package version numbers\nThere’s quite a bit of nuance - and surprises - to package version numbers - see the Package version number section for details. For example, using the utils::package_version() function, which parses package version strings into S3 classes, we get a suprising result:\n\n\"2.0\" &gt; \"10.0\"\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\npackage_version(\"2.0\") &gt; package_version(\"10.0\")\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\n\nWith that example, please do think about your package versions before setting them.\n\n5.2.1.1 WILDS Conventions\nFollowing the Tidyverse package version conventions, WILDS packages will use the following conventions (see the link for more details):\n\nAlways use . as the separator, never use -.\nA released version number consists of three components, &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;\nWhile a package is in between releases, there is a fourth component: the development version, starting at 9000 (e.g., 0.2.2.9000), and incrementing from there until the package has another release at which point return to three components.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Ignore these\nWe are not following or enforcing any rules about changes at the function/class/etc level below the package level. For example, the R Packages book talks about using the lifecycle package to deal with function changes.",

This book is a resource for the community of people using, contributing to, and maintaining software within the WILDS GitHub organization (<https://github.com/getwilds>) at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center Data Science Lab ([DaSL][]).

The book covers important aspects of software development, including how to get involved in software as a user or contributor, code style, code review, package documentation, and more. It includes both internal facing guidelines as well as for any contributions from folks other than DaSL staff.

- Contributing: @sec-contributing
- Style: @sec-style
- Code review: @sec-review
- Package documentation: @sec-docs
- Package maintenance: @sec-maintenance
- Security: @sec-security
- Conventions: @sec-conventions

In the WILDS we primarily develop software in the [R][] and [Python][] programming languages. Where necessary, we'll discuss a topic with respect to both languages.

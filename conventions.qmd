# Conventions {{< iconify fa6-solid person-digging >}} {#sec-conventions}

## Mention our employer

In all repositories in WILDS we will include mention of our employer. The following are examples for R and Python:

- R:
  - With the `usethis` package you can add an entry of type `person` to the DESCRIPTION file of your package

  ```r
  usethis::use_author("Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center", role = "fnd", email = "wilds@fredhutch.org")
  ```
- Python:
  - Add a dict in the authors block of the pyproject.toml file or other config file in your package

  ```python3
  {
    name = "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center"",
    email = "wilds@fredhutch.org"
  }
  ```

For other types of WILDS repositories, perhaps just add a mention to the README.

## GitHub Repositories

### Issue labels

In the WILDS repo `sixtyfour` there's [a set of 9 labels](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/labels) that have been proposed as common labels across WILDS repos. These aren't necessarily enforced across WILDS repos, but can be used.

Though we have not done this, one can set default labels for all repositories in WILDS - [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

A [blogpost](https://napjose.ph/posts/copy-issue-labels-from-another-github-repository) shows how to copy labels from one repository to another using the [gh command line tool](https://cli.github.com/) from GitHub. This command line method may be a better choice if weâ€™re not sure we want to go all in on default labels for every new repo. Here's the command:

```r
gh label clone getwilds/source-repo-name \
  --repo getwilds/destination-repo-name \
  --force
```

### Badges

WILDS projects will use badges to indicate their status. Badges are a widely used standard in source code repositories, and help quickly indicate to a potential user something typically important about the repository.

WILDS badges are maintained in a GitHub repository at <https://github.com/getwilds/badges>. There's a website for these badges and an easy click to copy interface at <https://getwilds.org/badges/>.
